# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security concerns that impact repos under the
[`graphql` GitHub org](https://github.com/graphql/) (including reference
implementations and official tools) may be responsibly disclosed to the TSC via
[any current TSC member](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#tsc-members-1),
with the expectation that they will be discussed and triaged by the TSC as a
whole. You may reach a subset of current TSC members via
[security@graphql.org](mailto:security@graphql.org).

Our goal is to provide complete, accurate, and actionable disclosures once a
reported issue has been sufficiently understood and there has been a reasonable
opportunity to deploy fixes responsibly. See
[the TSC security policy](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#security-policy).

Please note that TSC members are voluntary, geographically distributed, and tend
to have a lot of demands on their time - please be patient with us.
